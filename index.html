        Prohibited Combinations The DMV reviews requested personalized plate
        combinations and is not required to issue a requested plate. Generally
        avoid combinations using 3 letters followed by 4 numbers, or 5 numbers
        followed by 2 letters, such as 'ABC1234' and '12345AB'. These plate
        combinations are reserved by DMV and are not available as personalized
        plates.
      </p>
      <p>
        (2) Personalized plates bearing a plate number that represents a word,
        phrase, expression, or that has a meaning, connotation or format that
        the commissioner deems objectionable shall not be issued. Such plates
        shall include, but need not be limited to, those that the commissioner
        determines: (i) are obscene, profane, vulgar, repulsive, depraved, or
        lewd; (ii) describe or refer to a sexual or intimate body part, area or
        function; (iii) describe or refer to eliminatory or other bodily
        functions; (iv) are derogatory, contemptuous, degrading, disrespectful
        or inflammatory; (v) express, describe, advertise, advocate, promote,
        encourage, glorify, or condone violence, crime or unlawful conduct; (vi)
        describe, connote, or refer to illegal drug(s), controlled substance(s)
        or related paraphernalia; (vii) may constitute copyright infringement,
        or infringement of a trademark, trade name, service mark, or patent;
        (viii) refer to, suggest, or may appear to refer to or to suggest any
        governmental or law enforcement purpose, function or entity; (ix) do not
        have at least one letter, consist of six numbers followed by one letter,
        or may be misleading or confusing in identifying a plate number (e.g.,
        the substitution of the numeral zero for the letter “O”); or (x) are
        reserved for issuance to specific classes of vehicles other than
        passenger vehicles (e.g., plates assigned to county clerks, members of
        certain professions, historic motor vehicles, etc.).

        plate, which has navy plate numbers and says “Empire State.”
